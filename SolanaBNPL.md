# SolanaBNPL - Buy Now Pay Later on the Solana Blockchain

## Description

SolanaBNPL is a decentralized financial application built on the Solana blockchain that offers a Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) service. It enables users to make purchases and defer payments over a predefined period, making it easier for both vendors and borrowers to manage their finances. The application leverages the speed, security, and transparency of the Solana blockchain to provide a seamless and efficient BNPL experience.

## Key Features

- **Vendor Staking:** Vendors can stake a loan position by providing collateral in the form of SOL and USDC. This collateralization ensures that the funds are available to cover the deferred payments from borrowers.

- **Borrower Redemption:** Borrowers can redeem loan positions to finance their purchases. They can select items, choose the BNPL option at checkout, and receive instant approval based on their creditworthiness and collateral provided by vendors.

- **Automatic Payments:** SolanaBNPL automates the repayment process. Borrowers agree to repay their loans in 25% installments every two weeks for a total of 8 weeks. The application ensures timely deductions from borrowers' accounts.

- **Security:** The application implements robust security measures to protect user funds and sensitive data. Access control mechanisms and audits are in place to prevent unauthorized interactions.

- **Oracle Integration:** To accurately calculate loan positions, SolanaBNPL integrates with a trusted price oracle service that provides real-time SOL/USDC price data.

- **Governance:** The program includes a governance model, allowing users to participate in decision-making and vote on proposed program upgrades or changes.
